# Online Voting System in C++

This is a simple Online Voting System implemented in C++. The system allows users to cast votes for three different options, view the results, and manage their votes through a menu-driven interface. The project demonstrates basic concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) such as classes, methods, and data encapsulation.

## Features

- **Cast Vote**: Users can select one of three options to cast their vote.
- **View Results**: Users can view the current vote tally for each option.
- **Exit**: The program allows users to exit the voting system.

## Requirements

- C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)

## Files

- **main.cpp**: The main program that runs the voting system.
- **voting_system.h**: Header file containing the class declaration for the voting system.
- **voting_system.cpp**: Implementation file for the methods of the voting system.

## Compilation and Running

To compile and run the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lostsidedead/online-voting-system.git
   cd online-voting-system
